        <dc:description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An unforgettable novel about finding a lost piece of yourself in someone else.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Khaled Hosseini, the #1 &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;–bestselling author of &lt;em&gt;The Kite Runner &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;A Thousand Splendid Suns&lt;/em&gt;, has written a new novel about how we love, how we take care of one another, and how the choices we make resonate through generations. In this tale revolving around not just parents and children but brothers and sisters, cousins and caretakers, Hosseini explores the many ways in which families nurture, wound, betray, honor, and sacrifice for one another; and how often we are surprised by the actions of those closest to us, at the times that matter most. Following its characters and the ramifications of their lives and choices and loves around the globe—from Kabul to Paris to San Francisco to the Greek island of Tinos—the story expands gradually outward, becoming more emotionally complex and powerful with each turning page.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Amazon.com Review&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An Amazon Best Book of the Month, May 2013:&lt;/strong&gt; Khaled Hosseini’s &lt;em&gt;And the Mountains Echoed&lt;/em&gt; begins simply enough, with a father recounting a folktale to his two young children. The tale is about a young boy who is taken by a &lt;em&gt;div&lt;/em&gt; (a sort of ogre), and how that fate might not be as terrible as it first seems—a brilliant device that firmly sets the tone for the rest of this sweeping, heartbreaking, and ultimately uplifting novel. A day after he tells the tale of the &lt;em&gt;div&lt;/em&gt;, the father gives away his own daughter to a wealthy man in Kabul. What follows is a series of stories within the story, told through multiple viewpoints, spanning more than half a century, and shifting across continents. The novel moves through war, separation, birth, death, deceit, and love, illustrating again and again how people’s actions, even the seemingly selfless ones, are shrouded in ambiguity. This is a masterwork by a master storyteller. —&lt;em&gt;Chris Schluep&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Review&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;“&lt;em&gt;And the Mountains Echo&lt;/em&gt;ed opens like a thunderclap. . . . [Hosseini] asks good, hard questions about the limits of love. . . . Love, Hosseini seems to say, is the great leveler, cutting through language, class, and identity.  No one in this gripping novel is immune to its impact.”—&lt;em&gt;O, the Oprah Magazine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“With his third and most ambitious novel yet, Hosseini makes it clear that he's not ready to rest on his Big Name. . . . While it hits all the Hosseini sweet spots—nostalgia, devastating details, triumph over the odds—&lt;em&gt;And the Mountains Echoed &lt;/em&gt;covers more ground, both geographically and emotionally, than his previous works. It's not until Hosseini makes the novel small again, for the poignant conclusion, that you fully appreciate what he's accomplished.”—&lt;em&gt;Entertainment Weekly &lt;/em&gt;(A)&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Transports you whole into the otherworldly realms Hosseini builds in Kabul, Paris, San Francisco, and the Greek islands. . . . There's something primary and beautiful about the simple desire to get lost in a story, and Hosseini is an expert manufacturer of that experience.”—&lt;em&gt;Harper’s Bazaar&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Like a sculptor working in a soft medium, [Hosseini] gently molds and shapes individual pieces that ultimately fit together in a major work. . . . Family matters in ways small and large in this novel. Whether or not the connections are visible, they exist nevertheless. Hosseini seems to be telling us that the way we care is who we are and, ultimately, the face we show to life.”—&lt;em&gt;New York Daily News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Readers' tears may fall by first chapter's end . . . Introspective and perfectly paced, Hosseini's microcosmic plot spares no expense with sensory details. Each character . . . captivates. Hosseini skillfully weaves the tapestry with universal elements: human fallibility, innate goodness, perseverance, forgiveness, sexuality, jealousy, companionship, and joy. Yet his words are never sugarcoated: The brutality of life is on display, and people are shown just as they are, for better or worse. Poverty and gender roles leave scars, while shifting points of view reveal Hosseini's prism of truth. The heartbreaks are not intended for shock value, but they do linger. And the Mountains Echoed resonates to the core.”—&lt;em&gt;Austin Chronicle&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Like [Hosseini’s] previous books, the new novel is a complex mosaic, a portrait of the Afghan diaspora as it is folded into the West and of those left behind. . . . The book is elevated by a strong sense of parable and some finely drawn characters and is inventively constructed as it leaps from voice to voice.”—&lt;em&gt;Esquire&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Devoted readers will find it worth the wait.”—&lt;em&gt;Patriot Ledger&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Hosseini returns with an instantly relatable novel that follows generations of a troubled family across the Middle East.”—&lt;em&gt;Marie Claire&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The beautiful writing, full of universal truths of loss and identity, makes each section a jewel . . . Hosseini’s eye for detail and emotional geography makes this a haunting read.”—&lt;em&gt;Publishers Weekly&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Captivating and affecting . . . A masterful and compassionate storyteller, Hosseini traces the traumas and scarring of tyranny, war, crime, lies, and illness in the intricately interconnected, heartbreaking, and transcendent lives of his vibrantly realized characters to create a grand and encompassing tree of life.”—&lt;em&gt;Booklist &lt;/em&gt;(starred review)&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Hosseini weaves a gorgeous tapestry of disparate characters joined by threads of blood and fate. . . . In this uplifting and deeply satisfying book, Hosseini displays an optimism not so obvious in his previous works. Readers will be clamoring for it.”—&lt;em&gt;Library Journal &lt;/em&gt;(starred review)&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In &lt;em&gt;And the Mountains Echoed&lt;/em&gt;, Khaled Hosseini presents a multitude of windows into the souls affected by these events. The novel's rich kaleidoscope of images coalesces around one theme: the powerful and often excruciating legacy of family ties within the maelstrom of history.”—&lt;em&gt;Shelf Awareness&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Fiction Top Pick . . . Engrossing . . . Ultimately, &lt;em&gt;And the Mountains Echoed&lt;/em&gt; is about the human endeavor to transcend difference.”—&lt;em&gt;Bookpage&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</dc:description>
